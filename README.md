**Description**
The project tells about some amazing places in Russia, and also uses images for a deeper immersion in an amazing journey. As for the development methodology, bem methodology and nested file structure are used here.Moreover, to build the correct order of images and some blocks, I used grid layout. I also aligned the elements using flex. There is an adaptive layout here, it is implemented with the help of media queries.
